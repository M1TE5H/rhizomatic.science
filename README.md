## Introduction

Scientific education has been demarcated into monoliths, which has certain merits and benefits. However, such stark demarcation has also resulted into difficulties for those whose solutions lie at the intersection between different (branches of) fields.

## Motivation

The main aim of this website is to create a more fruitful and collaborative framework for modern scientific research. The other aims of this website include its role as a news and discussion forum as well as a resource for niche education. In the near future, this website will feature several articles that better articulate these aims.
